### Server [![build | not-stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-not--stable-red.svg)](https://github.com/thegergo02/ChatApp/releases/tag/v0.1-alpha.0)
To start the server, you have to type "**start**". [If you want to try it out just on your computer, type in 127.0.0.1 for IP, if you want to use it on local network, use your local ip address ("**ipconfig**" in cmd to get that), if you want to use it WAN, do the same thing just forward your port in the router to that address.]
